# Hardware and Software Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

- To run EyeMind for data collection, you need an eye-tracking device and a Computer Machine with Windows 10 or 11.

    EyeMind uses the Tobii Pro SDK (i.e., https://developer.tobiipro.com/python/python-getting-started.html) supporting Tobii Screen-based Eye-trackers (i.e., https://www.tobii.com/products/eye-trackers/screen-based). The tool was tested on Tobii X3-120 (i.e., https://connect.tobii.com/s/x3-downloads?language=en_US)

- To run EyeMind for data analysis, you need a Computer Machine with Windows 10 or 11.

## Software Requirements

- Git (i.e., https://git-scm.com/downloads) to clone the EyeMind repository from github.com
- Python 3.8.6 (i.e., https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/) (Choose the distribution AMD64 on win32 which is compatible with Tobii Pro SDK)
- Pip (i.e., https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows) (for a quick installation of Python Libraries)
- Npm and node.js (i.e., https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run EyeMind
- Tobii Pro Eye Tracker Manager (i.e., https://developer.tobiipro.com/eyetrackermanager/etm-installation-information.html) to install the eye-tracking device and conduct the calibration of the device

# Installation Procedure

EyeMind is composed of two services: the Eye-Tracking Server and the EyeMind App. This guide will walk you through the installation process for both services.

Start by cloning EyeMind to your local machine. In the following we will assume that the cloning folder is called "EyeMind".

    
    cd <root path>
    git clone https://github.com/aminobest/EyeMind

### Eye-Tracking Server Installation

Follow the steps below to install the Eye-Tracking Server:


- **Navigate to the EyeTrackingServer folder:**

    ```
    cd <root path>\EyeMind\EyeTrackingServer
    ```

- **Install Python dependencies:** Once you are inside the EyeTrackingServer folder, install the required Python dependencies using the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt --user
    ```

- **Set Permissions:** Ensure the folder "\EyeTrackingServer\out\logs" has read and write permissions (chmod 777). The eye-tracking raw data will be recorded here. Preserve this data, as it could be useful for future recovery.


### EyeMind App Installation


- **Navigate to the EyeMind App folder:** Open a new terminal window, and navigate to the EyeMind App folder using the command:

    ```
    cd <root path>\EyeMind\EyeMindApp\
    ```

- **Install dependencies:** Install the necessary dependencies using the command:

    ```
    npm run install-dependencies
    ```

- **Build the app:** Build the EyeMind App using the following command:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```


# User Manual

The video in  https://andaloussi.org/SoftwareX2023/demo.html illustrates the procedures explained in this section.

## Data Collection

### Important Notes

- **Supported Features:** The application supports 
   - Scrolling (using the mouse wheel or by dragging the model canvas) and zooming
   - Navigation between files
   - Changing the order of tabs, and horizontal scrolling on the tabs pane using either the mouse wheel or the left and right arrow icons on the tab pane to view more tabs.
   - Use for a secondary screen as long as the EyeMind is shown on the **primary screen**
-  **Unsupported Features:** The application does not support
   - Reading while scrolling
   - zooming the whole app (e.g., using the magnifier accessibility feature of Windows)
   - Using groups in the BPMN models.


### Setup of The Experimental Workflow in The EyeMind App

#### Running the EyeMind App

- Navigate to the EyeMind App folder:

    ```
    cd <root path>\EyeMind\EyeMindApp\
    ```

- Run the EyeMind App:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

#### Configuration

- Your computer should be plugged to a single screen
- To enable Symbolic links and breadcrumb navigation, the collapsed subprocess should have the same id as the sub-process file (you can do this use Camunda modeler)
-  The main process model should have the id "main" or "Main"
- The sub-processes should be stored in different files (avoid using the sub-processes links available in bpmn.io where one collasped sub-process, leads you to the underlying model)
- You should know in advance the following information

    - a. screen resolution (recommended 1920-1080)

    - b. screen dimension in inches
  
    - c. distance between the eye-tracker and the participant
-  There should be no display scalling in your computer

##### Models Import

- You can use "drag and drop" to add models
- The models should have unique file names (these files names should result in a unique pattern after applying filename.replace(/[\W_,.]/g,""))
- The order in which the files appear corresponds to the order in which they will show up in the file explorer
- Models of different processes should be asigned different group names

#### Questions Import

- The questions should be formatted in a csv file, with a structure similar to  [Examples/video demonstration material/Experiment-workflow/questions.csv/](Examples/video%20demonstration%20material/Experiment-workflow/questions.csv)
- The questions should have a unique id
- The type of each question can be "open-question" or "multiple-choice". If "multiple-choice", then the options should be provided in the following format: "<option 1>;<option 2>;<option 3>"
- Each question should be mapped to a specific process using the attribute model-group

####  Saving and Importing of Experimental Worflows for Future Data Collection

- After importing the models and the questions, you can press the red recording button at the top of the main view, provide the eye-tracking recoding settings and then save the session (with models, questions and eye-tracking settings)
- Afterwards, you can import this session and directly start the recording

#### Data Recording

- Once the models and the questions are loaded, or a session is loaded, you are ready to start the data collection 
- The tool will be set to full screen, but you can use the meta key to navigate to other tools

### Starting the Eye-Tracking Server


- Navigate to the EyeTrackingServer folder:

    ```
    cd <root path>\EyeMind\EyeTrackingServer
    ```

- Run the Eye-Tracking Sever using the following terminal command:

    ```
   python main.py
    ```

- Wait until you see "found tobii tracker at ...". If no eye-tracker is found. Please try again in about a minute (this is because the eye-tracker needs time to be recognized by the computer when connected)


### Calibration of the Eye-tracking device

- Use Tobii Pro Eye Tracker Manager to calibrate the eye-tracking device (cf.  https://andaloussi.org/SoftwareX2023/demo.html).

### Recording of The Eye-tracking Data using the EyeMind App

- Instruct the participants *NOT TO* to press the following: ctrl+r (refresh the app), ctrl+esc (go out from the full screen), alt (show advanced menu)

-  No window should superpose the recording window at any time
	
- Go to EyeMind tool and press the recording (red) buttom

- You must provide/see the following information in the form before you can proceed
  - X Screen dimension in pixels
  - Y Screen dimension in pixels
  - Screen distance in centimeters
  - Monitor size in inches
  - Recording ID
  
- Press start recording
- The main model and the first question will show up
- When the experiment is over, you can press the black sqaure (which refers to stop recording)

### Required Interactions with the EyeMind App and The Eye-Tracking Server When The Recording Is Over

- By the end of the recording, you will see the tool rendering some snapshots of your interactions with the process models. This is part of the procedure. Just wait.
- Wait until you see a message informing you that the data is saved. The message shows also the path of the saved data (i.e., <root path>EyeMind\EyeMindApp\outputData)
- After saving the file, wait a few seconds, then check that the file is in your folder before refreshing the app using crt+R

### General Notes:

- You can always start a new data collection session using ctrl+r (refresh). Remember that when you refresh all the non-saved data is deleted.
- In case the processing takes very long, you can use ctrl+shift+i to the open the developer tool and inspect the error.
- It is recommended to start a new instance of Eye-Mind for every new data collection or analysis session.

## Analysis

### File Import

- You can import several files corresponding to several data collection sessions.

### File Export

- You can export the following:
    - Analysis data (json)
    - Gaze data (csv)
    - Fixation data (csv) (you need to apply the fixation filter before you can export the fixation data)

### Fixation Filter
   - Use green filter button on the top menu access the fixation filter

### Heatmap and Overlays
  - Use the rainbow colored button to see the heatmaps and overlays
  - Choose one or several participants, question, metric, aggregation, timestamp unit and which BPMN elements to additionally include (activites, events, gateways, labels, data objects are included by default)
  - Use the file explorer to access the models 
  - To exit the heatmap and overlays press the same icon again

### Gaze Offset Correction
  - Use the red pointer icon on the top menu to access the gaze correction feature
  - Choose the data sample percentage on which you want to see the projections (for better performance, it is recommended to choose a small sample)
  - Use the file explorer to see the snapshots with gaze projections on each model
  - use the "general offset correction" menu to set corrections on the x and y axes. Note that the corrections here are only made to the data sample. so no data is affected yet.
  - Use the file explorer to see the snapshots with gaze projections on each model after the correction
  - If you are satisified with the correction you can apply it to the whole dataset. For this press "Apply correction to data", then a pop-up will open, press start, and wait until the rendering of snapshots (to redo the mapping between gazes and dynamic AOIs) is complete
  - Very Important note: for now, the gaze projections and corrections were tested on a computer with the same resolution on which the data collection has occurred.
  - To exit the gaze offset correction press its icon again

### General Notes
  - you can always start a new analysis session using ctrl+r (refresh). Remember that when you refresh all the non-saved data is lost. 
  - In case the processing takes very long, you can use ctrl+shift+i to the open the developer tool and inspect the error.

# Demonstration and Validation

## Video Demonstration

The following video demonstrates the features of EyeMind

https://andaloussi.org/SoftwareX2023/demo.html

## Demonstration Material

The material used in the demonstration video and generated throughout the demonstration video is available in [Examples/Video demonstration material](Examples/video%20demonstration%20material).

- [Experiment-workflow](Examples/video%20demonstration%20material/Experiment-workflow): This directory contains the material used for the data collection (i.e., Process models in a BPMN format, questions file in a csv format, eye-tracking session pre-loaded with all the experimental workflow files (models, questions) and settings)

- [collectedData](Examples/video%20demonstration%20material/Collected-data): This directory contains the data collected during the demo (i.e., EyeMind json file containing all the recorded raw data, fixation and gaze data in CSV format)

## Data Collection Material

The material (i.e., process models and questions) used in the experiment validating EyeMind is available at [DataCollectionValidation/experimentMaterial/](DataCollectionValidation/experimentMaterial/).

## Validation of Data Quality

To validate the quality of the eye-tracking data collected with EyeMind, we compared random data samples collected with EyeMind with corresponding samples recorded simultaneously using the commercial tool Tobii Pro Lab (cf. https://www.tobii.com/products/software/behavior-research-software/tobii-pro-lab?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzMXW9padgAMVM0GRBR0gxgC9EAAYASABEgLnEvD_BwE). 

The comparison involved confirming if both EyeMind and Tobii Pro Lab captured the same quantity of gaze events in each data collection session and if the events recorded by EyeMind matched those of Tobii Pro Lab in terms of timestamps and gaze coordinates. 
The results showed successful matching in all instances. 

Our Python Notebook in [DataCollectionValidation/dataCollectionValidation.ipynb](DataCollectionValidation/dataCollectionValidation.ipynb)  provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the comparison process.
